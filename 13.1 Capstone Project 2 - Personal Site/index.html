                <p>I am a full stack web developer student and IT enthusiast, studying in my spare time whilst also being a father to my two sons and working full time as a spare parts assistant at the engineering stores of Sofidel UK (Baglan) Ltd. Computers are a big part of my life and work, which revolves mainly around excel and the handling of data, but I have also recently designed a stock control system using ms access, query language and VB. Other areas of IT that I enjoy are audio and video production, gaming, graphic design and system builds/maintenace.</p>
